When it comes to grocery shopping, coupons are great, but Rebate apps are WONDERFUL. When something is on sale, you will be surprised at how little you need to pay when you pair it with coupons and rebates.

I'm not talking about the old-fashioned mail-in-rebates. With the rebate apps on a smartphone, most of the time you only need to upload pictures of your receipt (or even better, skip this by linking your store loyalty cards) to claim the rebates.

My favorite rebate app is [ibotta].
